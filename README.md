  <h1>Chat App Web</h1>
</div>

## Introduction

Chat-App is web project that I made when learning web development. It's inspired by WhatsApp and Messenger: in the app you can send messeges in realtime to users by private rooms or even group rooms.

When you talk in private room with someone he can recive your message even if he doesn`t you;

You can talk in group rooms with other users by adding them and you van remove them from the group.

## Technologies used

- [`React`](https://reactjs.org/) as the view layer of the app;
- [`Redux`](https://redux.js.org/) for managing the app's state;
- [`NodeJs and Express`](https://nodejs.dev/) as the main backend of the app;
- [`MongoDB`](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the databse fot the app;
- [`RxJs`](https://rxjs.dev/) for compose asynchronous or callback-based code;

... and some [more stuff](./package.json).
